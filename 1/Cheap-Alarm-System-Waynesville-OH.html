<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical considering that the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once customers realize that the economical consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
