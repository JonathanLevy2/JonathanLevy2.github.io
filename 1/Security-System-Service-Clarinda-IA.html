<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be utilized hardwired or completely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our screening, must supply at least a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending on use). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that provides seven days of totally free cloud storage (with more readily available for a month-to-month fee ).
