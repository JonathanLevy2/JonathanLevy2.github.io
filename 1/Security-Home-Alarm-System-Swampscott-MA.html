However, the fact that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute substantially to cops ability to nab robbers makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by authorities and whole communities (all taxpayers subsidize cops reaction to alarmed properties) a ineffective and expensive method to robbery reduction across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
