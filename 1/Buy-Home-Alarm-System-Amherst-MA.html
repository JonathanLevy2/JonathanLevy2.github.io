<h2>Tips To Secure Your Smart Home And IoT Devices Amherst</h2>

<p>Another method to keep recordings on a non-analogue media is through using a digital video recorder (DVR). Such a device is similar in performance to a PC with a capture card and suitable video recording software application Unlike PCs, many DVRs created for CCTV purposes are embedded gadgets that require less upkeep and easier setup than a PC-based option, for a medium to a large number of analogue cameras.
