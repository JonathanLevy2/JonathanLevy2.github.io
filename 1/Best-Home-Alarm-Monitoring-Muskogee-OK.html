<p>Pelco provides video surveillance cameras and video management services for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping centers, others, and hotels. Some people may state that we need to not have surveillance cameras in public locations. They declare that they attack privacy. The argument here, however, is why be out in public if you desire privacy? Surveillance cameras are suggested to keep you and other property safe, not to stalk you. Cameras are there not to invade an individual's privacy however to protect the general public by deterring criminal activity and by offering material evidence when a criminal offense has actually been caught on film.</p>

The process by which an alarm company gets signals from an alarm system and communicates an alarm dispatch demand to the municipality for the purpose of summoning police reaction to the alarm site.</p>

The systems are released for the protection of lives and residential or commercial property and not to enjoy people as they jaywalk throughout the street or run a red light (which both are, by the method, versus the law). Those are different solutions with different requirements and objectives.</p>
