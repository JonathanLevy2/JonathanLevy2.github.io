As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally typical since the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
