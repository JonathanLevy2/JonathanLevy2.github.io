<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally typical since the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
