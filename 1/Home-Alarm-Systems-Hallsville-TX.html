The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, however it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image. In our testing, nevertheless, we discovered the motion sensor to be touchy, with dreadful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot.
