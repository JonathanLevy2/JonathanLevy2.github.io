<p>Three huge advantages of wireless security systems for tenants are their impermanence, expandability and mobility. Tenants, unlike house owners, normally avoid making irreversible modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't useful; they involve drilling into walls and setting up long-term electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entryways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other parts can easily be set up at different residential or commercial properties in the future, and wireless systems are easily expanded with new components too. Wireless security plans also permit push-button control of the system and general home automation. If home automation is your primary appeal, have a look at our list of top systems with home automation features.</p>

So, how do we get your alarm to interact with the monitoring station? Much in the very same method you do - we can link by means of the web or via a wireless mobile phone signal.</p>
