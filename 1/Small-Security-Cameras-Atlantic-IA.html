<p>Three huge advantages of wireless security systems for tenants are their portability, impermanence and expandability. Tenants, unlike homeowners, generally avoid making irreversible modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't useful; they involve drilling into walls and installing irreversible electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entranceways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensors and other components can quickly be set up at various homes later, and wireless systems are easily broadened with new parts too.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
