The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses 7 days of complimentary cloud storage (with more offered for a monthly fee ). Nevertheless, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo states will allow the camera to properly identify motion and not get stuck recording on a loop.

Few home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, however almost all have digital zoom, which crop and enlarge whatever the camera is taping. The more megapixels a camera sensor has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still have the ability to see things clearly.</p>
