<p>The Canary is among the biggest cameras we tested, and it provides two-way communication with its paid Canary Subscription. The cost of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent throughout our screening. The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces. And despite having an attractive cost and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has confusing cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 each year to the cost of an otherwise budget plan camera.</p>
