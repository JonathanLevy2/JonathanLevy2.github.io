Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first concern you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The answer depends upon a couple of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you plan to save and the length of time you plan to keep recorded video footage. If there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video footage is going to consume storage space rapidly.

IP cameras that are linked to the same network, usually by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network.
