If there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video footage is going to consume storage space rapidly.

IP cameras that are linked to the same network, usually by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network.
