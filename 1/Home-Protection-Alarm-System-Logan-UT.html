<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>

Instead, you turn alerts on and off. As you can't disarm it, it can't do things that a normal self-monitored system can do like trigger a camera to record or activate the siren.
