Window sensors are quickly concealed behind blinds or drapes, and door sensing units are so small that they tend to blend into the doorframe. You can conceal a wireless camera a lot easier than you can one with wires. If you want home security that blends into your design and doesn't draw attention to itself, then wireless is the better choice. Wireless systems are also perfect for tenants because they do not require opening the wall, and can quickly be taken with you when you move to your next location.
