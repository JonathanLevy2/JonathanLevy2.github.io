<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are trusted by more than 60,000 services, universities, and government centers, and residential consumers. After investigating 4 different security systems, we decided on SSA. They gave us the very best description of their services and used us more for the cash. After having a bad experience with the local installer for ADT and canceling them, we experienced what a genuinely expert installation ought to be.

<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were outstanding in our testing-- throughout the day and at night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We need to note that the camera would occasionally downgrade the image quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which might vary throughout the day. Nest consists of the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
