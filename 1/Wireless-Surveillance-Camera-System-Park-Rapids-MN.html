Here is what this means, by method of an example. Assume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image throughout a far bigger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Utilizing an enough time random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly selected words) makes pre-shared key WPA essentially uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the last IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
