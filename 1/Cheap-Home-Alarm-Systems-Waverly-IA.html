<p>With Lorex security camera systems you get completely featured, professional-grade security solutions that are easy to install and basic to use. For several years, Macs were believed to be unsusceptible to infections and were rarely targeted by cybercriminals because they represented such a small percentage of the personal computing world compared to countless Windows users. But in the last few years, the increased appeal of Macs has made them more of a target, and security updates and patches can't always keep up. Sophos Home takes the stress out of security with automatic updates, effective Mac anti-viruses, and real-time protection from the latest malware and ransomware attacks. Plus, it includes extra security features, such as site stopping and web cam security.</p>

A couple of minutes into the DIY installation, our tester got stuck getting her control panel up and online-- it just would not link. An assistance window popped up with a number to call, and a Frontpoint rep assisted her troubleshoot the connection. After about 10 minutes, he might inform there was a concern with the circuit board. Definitely not perfect-- however the representative said sorry and shipped her replacement control panel overnight.</p>
