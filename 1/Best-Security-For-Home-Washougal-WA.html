<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
