<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
