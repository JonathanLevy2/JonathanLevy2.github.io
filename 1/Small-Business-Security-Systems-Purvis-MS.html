These surveillance cameras are classified as "commercial-grade" security cameras and are the type of camera used by these big box chains to secure their stock.

<p>Simply bought a bullet ip system and definitely enjoy it. Excellent clarity. I wanted to set up viewing on my mobile phone however had a couple questions that the tech addressed with ease. I Would certainly buy from cctvsecuritypros once again. I highly suggest this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand apart-- it's what provides the video history and smarter signals, for example. However, those functions come at a comparatively high price: $5 each month ($50 annually) for the very first camera for five days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 per year) for thirty days of video history.  For each extra camera, the subscription is marked down to about half of the preliminary cost.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
