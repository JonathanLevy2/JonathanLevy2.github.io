<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later produced to deal with the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be split. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily chosen words) makes pre-shared key WPA virtually uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the final IEEE 802.11 i change to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

For someone searching for a more complicated setup like home automation, or someone that wants a trained specialist to make the suggestion for the setup, specialist installation is an excellent option. We have actually found that many people that were concerned about self setting up a home security system actually ended up finding the process extremely simple. There are companies out there like Frontpoint that are known to be especially helpful in this phase.</p>
