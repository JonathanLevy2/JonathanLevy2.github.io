<p>A system that requires an agreement might be a smart choice for those who are cash-strapped or don't want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Due to the fact that contract-based security systems usually don't included in advance costs. Rather, the expenses are expanded over the length of the contract. We've seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year contracts!
