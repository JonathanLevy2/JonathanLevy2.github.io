<p>If you're a Google Homeowner, if you want a more attractive-looking system, or if you just don't want to put security in the hands of Amazon (Ring's parent company), SimpliSafe is a flexible, cost effective, and user friendly live-monitoring security choice.

We also found it easy to establish, scalable to big and small homes, and configurable with a range of accessories, from entry and motion detectors to fire and CO sensing units to leak and temperature level sensors. SimpliSafe also works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, allowing you to arm and check the system using only voice commands.
