<p>We enjoy that the Argus 2 comes with a color night vision alternative, however the black and white variation can really be clearer and offer you higher-quality video footage. This isn't truly a big deal considering the Argus 2's cost and all its other functions-- but for the record, stick with white and black. With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo clever service. But the coolest feature is that you can charge it with the help of solar power with a photovoltaic panel battery charger.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
