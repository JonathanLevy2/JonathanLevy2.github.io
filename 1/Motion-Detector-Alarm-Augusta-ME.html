<p>Closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance is a type of situational criminal activity avoidance developed to prevent both personal and property criminal offense and can be utilized in location of, or in addition to, cops. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send pictures of a particular location of interest and are either monitored remotely by security workers or preprogramed to scan the defined location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is thought that the increased surveillance offered by CCTV will reduce criminal activity and boost arrest, without displacing crime to other close-by locations where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
<p>The combination of digital video surveillance and gain access to control is part of the natural convergence of security innovations. Centralizing security into a single user interface uses extra details that may never ever have been possible previously, such as notification of a staff member, by name and identification number, entering the structure. A picture of that worker exists on screen for verification (confirming it's not a taken ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, making sure no tailgating happens.</p>
