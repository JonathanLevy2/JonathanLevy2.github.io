<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, the majority of burglar alarms work the exact same method. They use open and closed circuits to move an electrical existing. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking enables the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which implies when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will set off.</p>
