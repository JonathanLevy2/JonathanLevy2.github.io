<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
