<p>The NVR removes these issues, because it is rather linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just because they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>

<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 delivers totally free perks like individual detection, familiar-face signals, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage begins at $5 each month.) However, in our tests the familiar-face notifies worked just about 50 percent of the time and the camera routinely disconnected from the network several times a day (when everything else on our network appeared fine). The app was likewise painfully slow when we accessed live streams and taped clips, in addition to when we made modifications in the settings.</p>
