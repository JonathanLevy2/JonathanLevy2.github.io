<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical given that the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers realize that the economical customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
