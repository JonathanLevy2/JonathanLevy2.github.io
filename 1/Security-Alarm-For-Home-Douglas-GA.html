<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, due to the fact that it is instead connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just because they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transmit video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
