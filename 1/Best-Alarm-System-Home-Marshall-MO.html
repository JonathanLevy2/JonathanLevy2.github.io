The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
