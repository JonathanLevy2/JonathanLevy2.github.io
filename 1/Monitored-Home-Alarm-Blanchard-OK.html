<p>There have long been reputable guidelines governing the audio recording of individuals without their consent (there is a factor surveillance cameras never have microphones). It makes no sense that we do not have comparable laws for video recording. Wireless security systems utilize radio frequency (RF) or sometimes Wi-Fi connections to link security sensors to the overall system.

However, remember that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls must be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires verification from a personal security guard. A number of cities also require a permit to even own and operate a home security system. Guidelines such as these are developed to limit the time and resources that police and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Numerous towns will fine you for a lot of false alarms.</p>

Sensing units - The majority of clever alarm producers offer a mix of sensors in an alarm kit, so you'll need to work out the combination you require for your home.
