<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against fraud, theft, and vandalism. Tip: Typically keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we should again react to the alarm; each reaction is billed.

It can be managed remotely through voice commands and you have access to each part of the wired system from your mobile device or through the control board (also referred to as the alarm panel).

<p>Since it's more complex than it needs to be, we don't suggest the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, notifies, and integration all need separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing out on, thanks to prolonged and irregular spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

A self-monitored system does not suggest a property owner has to compromise any features. House owners can tailor the system to their needs and can choose to have the system expertly installed or do it themselves. Unlike other monitoring options, self-monitored systems do not have a regular monthly monitoring charge.</p>
