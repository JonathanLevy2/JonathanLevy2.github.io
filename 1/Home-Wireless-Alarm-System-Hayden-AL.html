The footage is going to eat up storage space rapidly if there are numerous cameras shooting in a greater resolution.

<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
