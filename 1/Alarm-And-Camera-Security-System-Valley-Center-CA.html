A lot of house owners who go with self-monitoring depend on a home security system that's specifically developed to send instant signals to their mobile phone once an alarm is activated.

<p>As an inducement to buy an alarm, a number of companies use "complimentary monitoring services" for the first couple of months. Lots of insurer offer discounts on insurance coverage premiums to customers with operable alarm systems. These discounts may be as much as 20 percent for commercial consumers, and a little less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many authorities departments offer several "free" false alarms prior to imposing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to respond is considerable right from the start. The deals of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance companies call into question the appropriateness of the present pattern in U.S. policing of allowing 3 or 4 complimentary incorrect alarms per fiscal year, due to the fact that they offer no up-front rewards to motivate owners to prevent false alarms.</p>

A local system does not have the capacity to pair with other clever devices and can not be controlled from another location. Likewise a local alarm will not call the authorities; it merely triggers an audible siren to signal people close by.</p>
