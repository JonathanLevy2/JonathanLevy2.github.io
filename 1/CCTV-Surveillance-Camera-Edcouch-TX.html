<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Available. ASecureLife's recommendation: Go to Ring for a well-priced DIY system that you can self-monitor or get professionally monitored for a small cost. We advise the eight-piece set because it features numerous door and window sensors for complete coverage. We also advise adding a doorbell video camera at some point. The upfront cost of wireless security systems can be pricey. Factor in the in advance cost of the control board, activation charges, monitoring charges and all equipment.
