Here's a look at Vivint security cameras for outdoor and indoor surveillance. Signed up for service for my Simon XTi and was active with their service an hour later on. The company that installed my alarm went out of business so I was on the hunt for a new monitoring company. These people are $18 a month more affordable and stayed in business 3 years so I'm comfy providing a try.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
