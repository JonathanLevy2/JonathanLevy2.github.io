Another potential drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool should be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working.

It has about 25 feet of visibility during the night. As such, even if somebody get into your home in total darkness, you'll still be able to see them in your smartphone app. The only concern here is that the taped footage will be white and black and a little dark so you may not be able to see details clearly.</p>

<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is more useful when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts every time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
