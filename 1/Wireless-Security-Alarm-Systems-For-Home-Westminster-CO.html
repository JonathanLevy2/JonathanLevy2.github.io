<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>

<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a type of situational criminal offense prevention designed to avoid both personal and property crime and can be used in location of, or in addition to, police. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transfer pictures of a particular location of interest and are either monitored remotely by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the defined area (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is thought that the increased surveillance offered by CCTV will minimize criminal activity and increase arrest, without displacing crime to other neighboring areas where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
