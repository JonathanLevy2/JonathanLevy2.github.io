<p>To determine reaction times for the monitoring company, we set off each system a minimum of five times, using contact and motion sensors. However, bear in mind that the monitoring company's response time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they respond at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls need to be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires verification from a personal security personnel. A number of cities also need a permit to even own and operate a home security system. Guidelines such as these are created to limit the time and resources that authorities and fire departments waste on false alarms. Many towns will fine you for too many incorrect alarms.</p>

This develops an air of unpredictability for potential thieves or vandals approaching from all instructions. If those circumstances sound like your life, Vivint and Link Interactive use some flexibility on monitoring agreement length if you buy equipment in advance.
