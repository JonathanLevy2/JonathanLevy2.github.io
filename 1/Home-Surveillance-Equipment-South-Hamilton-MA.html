<p>Discover how to create, build, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and lower criminal activity. The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, however it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with awful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are validating with Arlo whether our system was faulty, and so we may revisit this review. Basically, the Nest camera sits anywhere you put it and records what it sees, saving the last five days of footage to the cloud. The wide face of the camera provides you an outstanding visual field, and the photo you get is of good quality (you can alter the resolution; the better it gets, the more data you'll use to wait to the cloud.)
