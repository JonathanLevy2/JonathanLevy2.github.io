Renters, unlike property owners, usually prevent making permanent modifications to their homes.

But keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being damaged or harmed by the more determined robbers. They might also be less mindful about covering their faces and their tracks if intruders can not see any security cameras.</p>
