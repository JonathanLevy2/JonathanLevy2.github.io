<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are 3 times most likely to be robbed. If you want to watch on what's taking place in your house when you're not there, but you do not wish to purchase a full-fledged home security system, a Wi-Fi-connected camera is worth an appearance.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic.
