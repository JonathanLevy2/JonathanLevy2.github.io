With traditional CCTV security cameras, the video signal is processed and sent in analog format for local seeing from one main monitoring location.

Many insurance companies use discount rates on insurance coverage premiums to customers with operable alarm systems. These discount rates may be as much as 20 percent for commercial consumers, and a little less for residential owners. 16 In addition, lots of authorities departments use several "free" false alarms prior to enforcing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to respond is substantial right from the start. The deals of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance providers call into question the suitability of the current pattern in U.S. policing of permitting 3 or four totally free incorrect alarms per calendar year, since they offer no up-front incentives to motivate owners to avoid false alarms.</p>
<p>Some systems may depend on a keypad to go into access codes to disarm an alarm and equip.
