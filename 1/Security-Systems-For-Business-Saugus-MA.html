<p>Analog high definition cameras are a great choice for organisations to update from analog CCTV that has already been wired utilizing coax cable television or CAT-5 cable. AHD cameras utilize the same RG59 or RG6 cable as standard CCTV cameras. CAT-5 cable with video baluns can likewise be used. While professional monitoring costs more, it's more secure. When something triggers your alarm, your monitoring company will get the alert and then inform the authorities for you. Appears like a much safer bet to us.</p>
