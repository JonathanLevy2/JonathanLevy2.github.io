Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 annually) to save 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we typically discovered action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
<p>This Arlo Pro 2 camera likewise serves as a motion detector. It is geared up with a PIR (Passive Infrared) Motion Sensor, so whenever there's some motion detected, it can send you a push alert in your phone so you can respond to it right away.
