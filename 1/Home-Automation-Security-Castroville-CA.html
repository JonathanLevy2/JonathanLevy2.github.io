<h3>Best Wireless Home Security in California</h3>

<p>Many security systems have three main elements, which are a control board, sensors, and a monitoring center. A wireless home security system uses a radio frequency to interact. The radio frequency allows the alarm's sensors throughout your home to communicate with the control panel. Then the wireless control board communicates with the monitoring station through a cellular network, also called cellular monitoring, thus eliminating the need for a landline.</p>
