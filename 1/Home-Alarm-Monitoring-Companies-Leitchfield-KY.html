The $260 Basics plan consists of the base station, a keypad, 4 entry sensors, one motion sensor, a backyard sign, and 2 window decals.

The $25-per-month Interactive strategy adds control through iOS and Android smart device apps, push and email informs, and 30-day event-footage storage for unrestricted cameras, consisting of the SimpliSafe Video Doorbell Pro, which is offered separately.
