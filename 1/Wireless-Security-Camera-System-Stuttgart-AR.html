The camera features a rolling 2 week of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to save footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid membership plans for extra cloud storage.
