<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
