<p>To evaluate reaction times for the monitoring company, we set off each system a minimum of five times, using contact and motion sensors. Nevertheless, keep in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls must be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs confirmation from a personal security personnel. Several cities likewise require a license to even run a home and own security system. Guidelines such as these are developed to restrict the time and resources that authorities and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Many towns will fine you for a lot of incorrect alarms.</p>
