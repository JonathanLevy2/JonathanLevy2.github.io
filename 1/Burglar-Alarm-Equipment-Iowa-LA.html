<p>C. False Burglar Alarm. Make the purchase online for UL Central Station Alarm Monitoring. If using 4G LTE cellular or IP Internet, Select either landline or the proper interactive service. Select billing period: Monthly or Yearly. We get a 15% prepay discount rate from our UL central station provider which we pass on to our yearly customers. This is NOT an agreement, rather an annual prepay discount. When I ultimately got into the camera controls, I was fairly impressed. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a solid night-vision mode, and all the app controls are fairly obvious. You have actually got two-way audio, you can play tunes just to let the individual being seen understand they're being seen, and you can select to record video clips or images and save them to your clever device on a whim.</p>
