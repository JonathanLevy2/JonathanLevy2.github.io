<p>Discover how to create, build, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase staff member safety and minimize crime. The Ring Floodlight Webcam integrates two important devices in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight. When the Floodlight camera identifies motion, it switches on its two powerful LED beams as well as its sharp 1080p camera, and starts recording. The Floodlight Web cam also has a loud speaker, so you can talk to whoever's in front of the camera, and hear their reactions.
