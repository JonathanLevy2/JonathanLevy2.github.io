<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally typical given that the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
