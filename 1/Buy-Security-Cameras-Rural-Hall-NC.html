Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I evaluated, including creative things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one system.

Here's a take a look at Vivint security cameras for indoor and outdoor surveillance. Signed up for service for my Simon XTi and was active with their service an hour later. The company that installed my alarm failed so I was on the hunt for a new monitoring company.
