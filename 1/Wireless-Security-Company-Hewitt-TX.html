The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, however it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has a fantastic daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensor to be touchy, with awful night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal given that the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
