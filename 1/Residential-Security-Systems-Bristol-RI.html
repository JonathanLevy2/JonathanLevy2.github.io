Some small-business owners will likewise like Nest's contract-free plan choice. Sure, you get a lower price if you choose a three-year contract, however given that Nest needs you to pay 100% of your remaining agreement if you cancel, it's a big commitment. So pick what will be the much better deal for you. Go with the contract and gain those savings if you know you'll stay put for at least three years.
