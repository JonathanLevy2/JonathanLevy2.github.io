High-end home security companies like Vivint and ADT provide just professional installation. However most other companies on our best home security systems list give you a Do It Yourself option. ADT does not have the greatest customer care reputation among the companies we considered, racking up more than 3,000 grievances on its Bbb page While we chalked the majority of this as much as the truth that ADT has numerous million more consumers than its competitors, our tester began his call with low expectations.</p>
