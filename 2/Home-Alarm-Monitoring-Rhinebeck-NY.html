<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were impressive in our screening-- throughout the day and at night-- with a large, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We ought to keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the image quality based upon available bandwidth, which might vary throughout the day. Nest includes the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that might beat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
