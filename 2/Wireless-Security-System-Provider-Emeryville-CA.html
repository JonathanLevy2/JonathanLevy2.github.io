<p>Alarm systems have become standard equipment in shops and other organisations, and they're becoming progressively common in private homes too. A wireless security camera might require a cable television connection for power, but may use Wi-Fi for saving video. One benefit of a wireless security camera is its ease of installation.

<p>CCTV security cameras, otherwise referred to as closed-circuit tv, are a system of video feeds within a closed system readily available just to licensed users.

<p>Destructive actors will not be able to access your router's privacy settings from a device not linked to your wireless network once you turned off the remote gain access to. I feel this is an affordable way to go if you don't want monitored name brand alarm. This together with yard signs and window stickers (sold on Amazon) might suffice to hinder small time scoundrels.

With that said, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
