This permits you to have a record of occasions and can help aid law enforcement in the event of a break-in or vandalism. A closed-circuit is the most common, and when an electric current is continuously running around the border of the home, breaking the circuit - by opening a door or window - cuts off the electrical present. This trips the alarm system and sets off the matching alarm. Closed-circuit systems are likewise tripped if the burglar cuts the power, as the circuit is broken.</p>
