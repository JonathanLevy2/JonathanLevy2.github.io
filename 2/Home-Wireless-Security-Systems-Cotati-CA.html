<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment by doing this to make customers stick with them longer, due to the fact that switching monitoring companies means hundreds of dollars down the drain and a big headache for customers. How did they do it? They placed 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their newest software application and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and dusted within a day. They didn't say which device was the very first, and the last to fall, however.</p>
<p>As explained by Cornish and Clarke (2003 ), CCTV is a kind of official surveillance," meaning that not just does CCTV have the capability to take the place of authorities or gatekeeper but CCTV can also boost officers' abilities (Welsh and Farrington 2008).

On a bigger scale, the use of CCTV also provides the possibility of assisting in the criminal justice system, as video footage of a criminal activity might assist in prosecutions and investigations (La Vigne et al. 2011).</p>
