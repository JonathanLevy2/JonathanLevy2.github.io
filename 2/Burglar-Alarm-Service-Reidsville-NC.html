<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
