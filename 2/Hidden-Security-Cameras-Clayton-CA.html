<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a satisfaction to use as well (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you want to get into its cleverest customisations, there is a bit of a learning curve. For even more basic smarts, it's terrific, though.

<p>Despite the fact that 1080p is usually the basic resolution for cameras we have actually tested, there are benefits to models with higher-resolution sensing units. Few home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, but nearly all have digital zoom, which crop and increase the size of whatever the camera is taping. The more megapixels a camera sensing unit has, the more you can digitally focus and still be able to see things plainly.</p>
