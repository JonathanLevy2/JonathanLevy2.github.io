<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally regular because the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers realize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
