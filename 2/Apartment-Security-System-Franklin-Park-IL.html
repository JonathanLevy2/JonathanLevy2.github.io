<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security professionals investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Camera (KC120) for one of our top areas. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can record up to 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, but entries were frequently missing, in spite of appearing in the app's activity timeline. With basic wise home devices like automatic door locks, you can remain in bed and examine that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you look out for would-be package burglars or speak with visitors who drop in.</p>
