<p>The Hive View provides fantastic 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation triggered too quickly, even when on the most affordable sensitivity setting. Considering that this camera has no native geofencing features, you have to by hand stop notices (and recording, considering that it does that even when notifications are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity concerns, with two Hive test systems disconnecting eight times over 2 months.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
