Here is what this suggests, by way of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image across a far bigger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations.

As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when customers understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
