<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
