As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally regular given that the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
