The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, however it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our screening, however, we discovered the motion sensor to be sensitive, with terrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are confirming with Arlo whether our unit was faulty, therefore we might review this evaluation.
