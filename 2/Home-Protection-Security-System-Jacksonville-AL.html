<p>Carbon monoxide gas detection. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas that can be harmful to both humans and animals.

<h3>Wireless Monitored Home Security System in Alabama</h3>
<p>Surveillance systems present police "bad apples" with an appealing chance for criminal misuse. In 1997, for instance, a top-level police official in Washington, DC was caught utilizing cops databases to gather details on patrons of a gay club. By searching for the license plate numbers of parking lot at the club and looking into the backgrounds of the cars' owners, he attempted to blackmail patrons who were wed.

<p>Network cameras can be utilized for extremely cheap surveillance solutions (needing one network camera, some Ethernet cabling, and one PC), or to change entire CCTV setups (cameras become network cameras, tape recorders become DVRs, and CCTV monitors ended up being computer systems with TFT screens and specialised software. Digital video manufacturers claim that turning CCTV installations into digital video setups is inherently better).</p>
<p>It would be easy to roll your eyes at this last point, but it suggests you can ask your home security camera for the weather report - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the system will respond.
