The answer depends upon a couple of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived footage you mean to store and how long you prepare to keep documented footage. If there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video is going to consume storage area quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest footage when you reach the system's capacity, however if you're not careful, the system may overwrite archived video footage that you still require.</p>

<p>Some wireless home security systems use a video recording storage option and others do not. For the ones that do not, you are able to see a live video feed of your home whenever you access your system; nevertheless, nothing is recorded. The systems with video storage generally consist of either a local storage or cloud storage alternative. A local storage choice saves a pre-determined variety of video clips on the device itself. This alternative is normally cost-free. A cloud storage alternative saves your video in the cloud. However, this is usually a paid service and the variety of hours it will keep will depend upon just how much cloud storage you want to spend for.</p>
