<p>Nurse calling systems normally consist of emergency buttons or pull strings within the client's toilet. If a patient is having trouble, he can push the button or pull the string and it will send out an alert to the nurse station. This is an easy switch that is normally open or generally closed. The majority of your commercial security cameras consist of dry contact input ports to incorporate alarms and informs, sensors, gain access to control, and so on. My mind conceived an approach of not just providing the client with the patient-monitoring system however incorporating it into their old-fashioned nurse call station system.</p>
<p>It would be easy to roll your eyes at this last point, but it suggests you can ask your home security camera for the weather report - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the system will reply.

Which, you envision, would be enough to send even the most dedicated career criminal scampering empty-handed down the roadway.</p>
