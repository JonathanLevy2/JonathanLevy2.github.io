<p>We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complex than it should be. Recordings, informs, and combination all require separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for 1 month.
