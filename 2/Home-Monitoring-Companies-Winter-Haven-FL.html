For the ones that don't, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home whenever you access your system; however, nothing is tape-recorded. The systems with video storage typically include either a local storage or cloud storage alternative. A local storage alternative saves a pre-determined number of video clips on the gadget itself. This alternative is normally cost-free. A cloud storage option saves your video in the cloud.
