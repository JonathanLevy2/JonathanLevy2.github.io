Nevertheless, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can tape up to 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, but entries were often missing, in spite of appearing in the app's activity timeline. With standard smart home devices like automated door locks, you can stay in bed and check that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you look out for prospective package thieves or speak with visitors who drop in.</p>
