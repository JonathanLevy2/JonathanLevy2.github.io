IP cameras that are connected to the same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will be compatible with a provided video recorder before buying.</p>
