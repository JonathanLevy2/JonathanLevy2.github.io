<p>Nurse calling systems generally consist of emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the patient's toilet. He can push the button or pull the string and it will send out an alert to the nurse station if a patient is having problem. This is a simple switch that is usually open or usually closed.

<p>Arlo develops terrific home security cameras, and this third-generation Arlo Pro is a prime example of what this company can.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
