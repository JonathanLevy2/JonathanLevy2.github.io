<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system utilizing a $2 remote. When it identified any type of interference, SimpliSafe responded with a statement saying the system would inform users. The company also questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be a perfect storm of scenarios for someone to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using 2 various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units situated 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to reproduce the concern. Although our testing should not be taken as definitive, our company believe this concern is not likely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe consumers who own the existing system.</p>

We should note that the camera would periodically downgrade the picture quality based on offered bandwidth, which might change throughout the day. Nest includes the choice to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that might defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>

Go for designs that utilize infrared (IR) technology if you're looking for night vision cameras that provide the brightest and best night view.

Although the cameras evaluated in this guide do have basic security features, they can't replace a complete home security system, that includes windows and door and motion sensors, smoke alarm, and so on.</p>
