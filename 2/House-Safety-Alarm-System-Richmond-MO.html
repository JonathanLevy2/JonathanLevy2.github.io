<p>This nifty clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. During screening, we found it was simple to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren rapidly activating when motion was spotted. We like that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your home, which can get costly. It's also worth noting that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it only keeps an eye on for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly. It also had the quietest alarm of all that we evaluated and there's no external monitoring service readily available.</p>
