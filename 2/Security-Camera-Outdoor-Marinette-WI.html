<h2>Fire Alarm Monitoring in Marinette</h2>
<p>The implicit reason for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the risk of terrorist attacks. However suicide opponents are clearly not prevented by camera - and may even be brought in to the television coverage cameras can make sure - and the expense of a comprehensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up around 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget plan - far goes beyond the limited benefits that the system might provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact (see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
