<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
