<p>Pelco offers video surveillance cameras and video management services for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping hotels, others, and centers. Some individuals might say that we must not have surveillance cameras in public places. They declare that they get into privacy. The argument here, however, is why be out in public if you desire privacy? Surveillance cameras are implied to keep you and other residential or commercial property safe, not to stalk you. Cameras are there not to invade an individual's personal privacy but to protect the general public by deterring criminal activity and by providing material proof when a crime has been captured on movie.</p>
