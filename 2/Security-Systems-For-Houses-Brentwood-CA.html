<p>Professional installation was almost the only way to put in a home security system 15 years back. Innovation has actually come such a long way that DIY systems can provide the exact same level of security (and often more) with a self set up system. Even more, there can be fringe benefits to a Do It Yourself system since they're generally a lot easier to move to another home if you move. For someone searching for a more complicated setup like home automation, or somebody that desires a trained professional to make the recommendation for the setup, specialist installation is a fantastic option.
