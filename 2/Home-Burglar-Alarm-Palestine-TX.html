<p>Establishing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or residential property is the duty of the entire community. Storage capability: For video recorders, the first concern you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The response hinges on a couple of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you plan to save and the length of time you prepare to keep taped footage. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video footage is going to eat up storage space quickly.
