In the London train bombings in 2005, terrorists brought bombs onto buses and trains, detonating them throughout heavy traffic. After the tragic attacks, police evaluated CCTV camera footage and saw the terrorists going into the train station, bring knapsacks loaded with explosives. The terrorists were tape-recorded on several CCTV cameras, but regrettably they were neither observed nor intercepted before they were able to carry out the attacks.</p>
