The offers of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance companies call into question the appropriateness of the existing pattern in U.S. policing of allowing 3 or four totally free false alarms per fiscal year, because they provide no up-front incentives to encourage owners to prevent incorrect alarms.</p>
