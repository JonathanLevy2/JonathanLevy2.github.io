The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation slowly progressed into the highly advanced yet economical systems available today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to tape video and see it later on.
