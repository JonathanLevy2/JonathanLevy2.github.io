<p>The Hive View provides excellent 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation triggered too easily, even when on the lowest sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing features, you need to by hand stop notices (and recording, since it does that even when alerts are off). We also experienced above-average connection concerns, with 2 Hive test units disconnecting 8 times over two months. Scout is extremely easy to utilize, particularly if you're a fan of mobile phones. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based web browsers, and it permits you to control practically every aspect of the security system remotely, and it's highly adjustable.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
