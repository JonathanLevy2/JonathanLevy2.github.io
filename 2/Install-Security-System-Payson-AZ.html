Because this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to manually stop notices (and recording, because it does that even when notifications are off).

<h3>Best Home Security Service Providers in Arizona</h3>
<p>We do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complex than it needs to be. Recordings, informs, and combination all require different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing, thanks to lengthy and irregular gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs whenever you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
