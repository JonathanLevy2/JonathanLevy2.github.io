<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a destructive attacker, because the disruption of the network prevents the flow of data and really indirectly secures information by preventing it from being sent. The usual reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, providing an opportunity for the destructive assaulter to record these codes and utilize numerous splitting tools to evaluate security weaknesses and exploit them to acquire unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools offered which can release a dictionary style attack of "potentially accepted" security keys based on the "model" security key recorded throughout the network recovery.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal considering that the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers recognize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
