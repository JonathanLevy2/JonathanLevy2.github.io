You could spend a similar amount for the best home security system, but they don't monitor your cameras as proactively as Deep Sentinel. But, they're the very best home security cameras if you're trying to find active monitoring.

Some alarm systems utilize real-time audio and video monitoring technology to validate the legitimacy of an alarm. In some towns around the United States, this kind of alarm confirmation allows the property it is securing to be put on a "validated reaction" list, allowing for quicker and more secure authorities reactions.</p>
