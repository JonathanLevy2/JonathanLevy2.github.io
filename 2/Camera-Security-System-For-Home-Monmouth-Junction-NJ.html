We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.

Instead, you can filter occasion notices only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes.
