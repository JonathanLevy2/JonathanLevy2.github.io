<p>DITEK's burglar alarm surge protectors safeguard your security system against short-term surges that can go into through A/C power lines, telephone lines and remote notification zones. Home automation is practical and easy, and wireless systems help you automate your home that a lot easier. Smart locks, programmable thermostats, cameras, and other automatic home devices are by their very nature wireless, and most home security companies offer a home automation plan with an app to remotely manage everything on the system. That isn't to say that you can't have wired home automation, due to the fact that you can, but automated equipment that is hardwired into your system is slower and harder to encrypt. It isn't extremely wise. Wireless devices communicate more firmly and faster to other devices on the system and to the monitoring center (if you choose monitoring).</p>
