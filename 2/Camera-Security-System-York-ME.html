<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.

Rather, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts every time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
