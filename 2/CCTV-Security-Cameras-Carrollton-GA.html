<h3>Good Security Systems For Home Carrollton GA 30117</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don.

We concur with you about Blink's exceptional battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, however its recording capacity is a bit minimal to recommend as a top choice.</p>
<p>Arlo builds fantastic home security cameras, and this third-generation Arlo Pro is a prime example of what this company is capable of. While it doesn't have the eye-popping 4K resolution of the Arlo Ultra, it delivers fantastic video quality and a lot of that more-expensive camera's other signature features for less. And it can be released inside your home or out. The Brinks Home Security system is available in 2 bundle options. The Home Total design is $29 monthly. For those who want to use higher-end features such as Live Video Streaming and Cloud Video Storage, the month-to-month charge is $39.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
