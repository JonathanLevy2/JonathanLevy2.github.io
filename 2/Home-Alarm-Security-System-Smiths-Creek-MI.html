Salt Lake City needs verification from a private security guard. A number of cities likewise require an authorization to even own and operate a home security system. Guidelines such as these are created to limit the time and resources that authorities and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Lots of municipalities will fine you for too many false alarms.</p>
