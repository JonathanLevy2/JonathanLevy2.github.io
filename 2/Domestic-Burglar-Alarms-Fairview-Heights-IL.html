<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, scams, and theft. Idea: Often keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset.

<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, dealing with advanced smart home connoisseurs or fans of a particular ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I checked, including creative things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one system.
