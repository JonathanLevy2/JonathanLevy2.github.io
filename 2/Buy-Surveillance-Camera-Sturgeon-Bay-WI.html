<p>Reliability has long been at the heart of the dispute over hardwired versus wireless home security systems.

IP cameras that are connected to the exact same network, typically by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will work with a given video recorder prior to purchasing.</p>
