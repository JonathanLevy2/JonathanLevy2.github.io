In regards to detection, it is better to have a camera geared up with infrared detection as opposed to motion detection. This will supply more accurate and less regular informs because oftentimes the motion detection is triggered by motion such as a tree blowing or an animal running by.</p>

<p>We required guards for our annual Coats for the Cold occasion to secure the line camping tent and structure, keep order in the wee hours of the early morning and to begin the heating unit at 5am. The very first guard arrived early so he could take a look at the entire location and talk with me about my issues. He was professional, courteous and very encouraging. The 2nd guard arrived in the middle of the night and took over. When I showed up in the early morning to get the occasion started, he was also expert, polite and reassuring. We were really delighted with your service and I will suggest that we call on your company next year for this event. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep. I didn't worry once after leaving our home in your hands.</p>
