<h3>Safety Alarm System For Home Bernalillo NM 87004</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don.

<p>This awesome wise alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. Throughout testing, we found it was easy to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren rapidly activating when movement was spotted.
