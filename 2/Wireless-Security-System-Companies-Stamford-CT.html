<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs each time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
