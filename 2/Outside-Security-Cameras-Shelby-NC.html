Bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor choices since their design enables minimum glare.

Residence has actually upgraded that variation with 4G cellular backup and an onboard Z-Wave 500 Series chip, which supplies a much better variety for sensing units. Both the original Residence system and the Residence Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, however the Iota is the only model we checked that also deals with HomeKit. We've experienced a couple of technical concerns while long-lasting testing the Residence Iota, and so will continue to evaluate and upgrade appropriately. We no longer advise it.</p>
