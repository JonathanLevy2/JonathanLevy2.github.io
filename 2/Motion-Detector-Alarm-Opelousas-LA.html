<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the very same resolution specification as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much larger area and for that reason offers less pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by way of an example. Assume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image across a far bigger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
<p>Unlike many other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs whenever you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
