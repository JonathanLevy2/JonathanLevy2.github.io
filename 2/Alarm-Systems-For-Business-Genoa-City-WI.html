<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product classification is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security experts investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Web Cam (KC120) for among our top spots. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape approximately 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, but entries were frequently missing, in spite of appearing in the app's activity timeline.

Throughout our hands-on testing of Brinks, we found the systems to be rather easy to set up and use-- but not rather as basic as brands like SimpliSafe or Ring Alarm.</p>
