<p>If you have an interest in a 4K camera system, you ideally will have a very high-speed Web connection and a robust home network, preferably an enterprise-grade network. As discussed above, the 4K camera images are very large, and that is a lot of information to push around the home's network and optionally, to an offsite cloud recording service (more on that below). Rely on your HTA Qualified technology professional for suggestions here, as they will be able to figure out if a 4K camera system will work in your scenario. Some of the much better camera system brands have controls to adjust a few of the recording parameters in order for slower network connections to still work reliably. Remember that 1080p resolution generally has sufficient information to provide important video info while protecting network bandwidth and hard disk drive storage.</p>
<p>When looking at a typical camera image, you would be hard-pressed to tell the difference in between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one major advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to deal with detail after the fact, which implies that users can zoom in on details such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. However, while 4K resolution provides some advantages, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are very large and use up a great deal of taping storage space. So much, in fact, that they need about four times the disk drive area of 1080p to tape-record the same length of video footage. If extended video storage is crucial, be prepared to spend more money.</p>
