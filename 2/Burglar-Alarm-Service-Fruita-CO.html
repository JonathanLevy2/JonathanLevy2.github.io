<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don.

<p>When looking at a normal camera image, you would be hard-pressed to inform the distinction in between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one significant advantage of 4K resolution is the capability to deal with information after the truth, which indicates that users can focus on information such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. However, while 4K resolution uses some advantages, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are huge and use up a lot of recording storage space. So much, in reality, that they need about 4 times the hard drive area of 1080p to tape-record the exact same length of video footage. Be prepared to spend more money if extended video storage is necessary.</p>
