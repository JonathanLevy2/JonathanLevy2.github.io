<p>After buying, installing, and utilizing these systems for eight months, we discovered 4 standout companies. Vivint, Frontpoint, ADT, and SimpliSafe all provide an exceptional client experience and intuitive, ingenious security tech. We 'd be comfortable equipping our own homes with any of them-- although each excels in a specific location.

<p>A system that requires an agreement might be a wise choice for those who are cash-strapped or do not want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Since contract-based security systems generally do not included in advance costs. Rather, the costs are expanded over the length of the agreement. We've seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year contracts!

<p>When installing cameras inside your house isn't a choice, you may want to check out hidden cameras, which are cameras that are small and discreet, often fitted into daily objects such as clocks, smoke detectors, and magnets. If you need to record a crucial meeting in a public place, an individual hidden camera developed into a watch or pen might be a good option. Finally, if you just wish to see what your staff members depend on when you aren't close by, a hidden camera connected to a CCTV camera system may be the best choice.</p>
