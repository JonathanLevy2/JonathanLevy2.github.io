<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were excellent in our screening-- throughout the day and during the night-- with a large, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We need to note that the camera would periodically downgrade the picture quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which could fluctuate throughout the day.

(The remainder of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) However because most retail theft would not journey an alarm anyhow (an employee slipping some extra cash while offering a customer change, for instance), we believe it's more vital to have high-quality images so you have the proof you need. Which's what Nest offers you.</p>
