<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, most alarm systems work the exact same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electric current. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. If the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits, which means. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be moved. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door enables the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which implies when the doors are shut the alarm system will set off.</p>
