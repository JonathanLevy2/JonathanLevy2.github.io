If alarm use led to improved public safety-- that is, alarms caused much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer robberies throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more evident. However, the reality that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute significantly to cops ability to apprehend robbers makes the underwriting of alarm action by authorities and whole communities (all taxpayers support police reaction to alarmed homes) a ineffective and costly approach to robbery decrease throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
