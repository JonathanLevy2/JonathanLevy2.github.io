We also experienced above-average connection concerns, with 2 Hive test systems detaching eight times over 2 months. Scout is very easy to use, especially if you're a fan of mobile phones.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>

Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I checked, including creative things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit.
