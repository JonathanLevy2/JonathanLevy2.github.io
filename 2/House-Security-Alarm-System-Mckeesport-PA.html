Nevertheless, we had a handful of tests where recordings cut out in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second gaps in between clips. Protective Systems uses a touch-screen control panel and keypads, different sensors (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes.

<p>When looking at a typical camera image, you would be hard-pressed to tell the difference in between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one major advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to resolve detail after the fact, which suggests that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution uses some benefits, it likewise brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are huge and use up a lot of taping storage space.
