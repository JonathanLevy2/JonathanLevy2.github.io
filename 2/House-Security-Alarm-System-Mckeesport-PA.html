Nevertheless, we had a handful of tests where recordings cut out in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second gaps in between clips.

<p>When looking at a typical camera image, you would be hard-pressed to tell the difference in between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one major advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to resolve detail after the fact, which suggests that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays.
