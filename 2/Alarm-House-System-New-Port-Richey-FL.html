CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal offense prevention technique, which argues that chances to anger can be decreased by changing a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the danger of a wrongdoer being nabbed, increasing the effort to dedicate the crime, decreasing rewards from criminal offense commission, and lowering provocations that generate criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011).
