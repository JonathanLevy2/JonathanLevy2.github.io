The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, but it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with terrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our unit was malfunctioning, and so we may review this review. Basically, the Nest camera sits wherever you put it and records what it sees, conserving the last five days of footage to the cloud. The wide face of the camera offers you a remarkable field of vision, and the image you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the better it gets, the more data you'll use to save it to the cloud.) To see that video footage, you can use an app on your phone or an internet browser link on your computer.</p>
