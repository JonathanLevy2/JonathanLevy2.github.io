<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are three times most likely to be robbed. With years of experience monitoring and setting up video and audio security systems for Seattle organisations and homes, we've built fantastic relationships with both local police forces and their customers. Likewise, do not forget that your wireless network security can be often weak, and prone to exploits.

Aside from security, Outright Security Alarms has home automation products and solutions. 2GIG's control board can speak and control basic home automation products like door locks, lighting, thermostats, and small device modules.</p>
