Sensing units - A lot of smart alarm makers provide a mix of sensors in an alarm kit, so you'll need to exercise the combination you need for your home.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic.
