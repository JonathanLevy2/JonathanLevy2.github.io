<p>Amongst IP security choices, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send information over a wireless network. These security cameras connect to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the footage from anywhere. A common mistaken belief is that wireless implies the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still require a power cable. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder directly which then links to the internet and a router. Lastly, wire-free cameras are completely cable television free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are needed, these are the easiest option to install and all of the recorded video is saved in the cloud.</p>
