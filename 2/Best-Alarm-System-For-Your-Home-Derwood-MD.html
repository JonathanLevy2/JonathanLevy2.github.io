<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Offered. ASecureLife's suggestion: Go to Call for a well-priced Do It Yourself system that you can self-monitor or get professionally monitored for a small cost. We suggest the eight-piece package because it includes multiple door and window sensors for full coverage. We also suggest including a doorbell camera at some time. The upfront cost of wireless security systems can be expensive. Consider the in advance cost of the control panel, activation charges, monitoring charges and all equipment.
