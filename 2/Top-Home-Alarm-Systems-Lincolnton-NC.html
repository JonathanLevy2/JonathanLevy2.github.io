It features HD live streaming, motion signals, individual notifies and access to the Nest Aware service choice.

<p>The Canary is among the largest cameras we tested, and it provides two-way interaction with its paid Canary Subscription. The rate of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant during our testing. The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to recognize already-identified faces.
