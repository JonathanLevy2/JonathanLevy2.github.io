<p>This cool wise alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. During testing, we discovered it was basic to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was precise, with the siren quickly setting off when motion was spotted. We love that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your property, which can get pricey. It's also worth keeping in mind that it needs to be set up on the ceiling (it just keeps track of for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.
