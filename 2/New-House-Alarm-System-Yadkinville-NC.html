<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
