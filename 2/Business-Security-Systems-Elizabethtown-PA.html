<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
