<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that appears to strive to make a camera with the most challenging setup known to man.

Windows smash, dogs wail, felines squeal, infants weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first 10 seconds. It does not work. And it never ever works.</p>

Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I tested, consisting of clever things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit.
