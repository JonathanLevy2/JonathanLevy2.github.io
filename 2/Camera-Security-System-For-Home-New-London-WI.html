Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transfer pictures of a specific location of interest and are either monitored remotely by security workers or preprogramed to scan the defined area (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance supplied by CCTV will minimize crime and boost arrest, without displacing crime to other close-by locations where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>

For somebody trying to find a more intricate setup like home automation, or somebody that wants a trained expert to make the suggestion for the setup, expert installation is a fantastic option.
