The subscription is more useful when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts whenever you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
